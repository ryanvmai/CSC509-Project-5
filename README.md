## **What is this repository?**
This repository is for computer science 509 project 5 which contains many practice problems with arrays and loops. The Project Euler ones are challenging array and loops problems whereas the CodingBat ones are more streamlined and better for initial learning.

## **Array Problems**
### **Project Euler**
[**Problem 7**](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

What is the 10,001st prime number?

[**Problem 10**](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10)

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

[**Problem 17**](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

[**Problem 25**](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25) (*Incomplete*)

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

### **CodingBat**
[**makeMiddle**](https://codingbat.com/prob/p265802)

Given an array of ints, return a new array containing the middle element(s) from the original array. If the length of the parameter array is odd, the result array will be length 1. If the parameter array has an even length, the result will contain the middle two values. The original array will be at least length 1.

[**has23**](https://codingbat.com/prob/p171022)

Given an int array length 2, return true if it contains a 2 or a 3.

[**canBalance**](https://codingbat.com/prob/p158767)

Given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

## **Other**
I added descriptions to Emma's README.md. Her repository can be found [here](https://github.com/esly20/Project5_ESlibeck).
